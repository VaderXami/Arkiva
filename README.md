# Arkiva
Arkiva is a MVC Web Application.

The purpose of this web application is to make possible a "storage" for different files based on Subject.
By Subject we understand a public/private institution in which they provide product or services, example: Microsoft.
After we register a Subject it is possible that for this Subject we can add an Inspection public/private, example: Duke Inspection Services.
We are able also that for each inspection we can add different types of documents such as: JPG, PNG, JPEG, Word Document, PowerPoint Documet, and Excel Document.

Hierarchy Subjects/Inspection/Documents/files .

Also you are able to not only create, update names or delete, but also to download specific files or all of them according to the Subject in a zip file.
